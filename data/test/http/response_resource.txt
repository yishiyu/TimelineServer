Switch on the power line, remember to put on
PROTECTION
Lay down your pieces and let's begin
OBJECT creation
Fill in my data parameters
INITIALIZATION
Set up our new world and let's begin the
SIMULATION

If I'm a set of points then I will give you my
DIMENSION
If I'm a circle then I will give you my
CIRCUMFERENCE
If I'm a sine wave then you can sit on all my
TANGENTS
If I approach infinity then you can be my
LIMITATIONS

Switch my current
To AC to DC
And then blind my vision
So dizzy so dizzy
Oh we can travel
To to A.D to B.C
And we can unite
So deeply so deeply

If I can, If I can give you all the
STIMULATIONS
Then I can, then I can be your only
SATISFACTION
If I can make you happy, I will run the
EXECUTION
Though we are trapped in the strange strange
SIMULATION

If I'm an eggplant then I will give you my
NUTRIENTS
If I'm a tometo then I will give you my
ANTIOXIDANTS
If I'm a tabby cat then I will purr for your
ENJOYMENT
If I'm the only god then you're the proof my
EXISTENCE

Switch my gender
To F to M
And then do whatever
From AM to PM
Oh switch my role
To S to M
So we can enter
The trence the trence

If I can, If I can feel your
VIBRATIONS
Then I can, then I can finally be
COMPLETION
Though you have left
You have left *5
me in
ISOLATION

If I can, If I can erase all the pointless
FRAGMENTS
Then maybe, then maybe you won't leave me so
DISHEARTENED
Challenging your god, you have made some
ILLEGAL ARGUMENTS

EXECUTION x12
EIN
DOS
TRIOS
FEM
LIU
EXECUTION

If I can, If I can give them all the
EXECUTION
Then I can, then I can be your only
EXECUTION
If I can have you back, I will run the
EXECUTION
Though we are trapped, we are trapped ah

I've, I've studied how to properly
LO-O-OVE
Question me question me I can answer all
LO-O-OVE
I know the algerbratic expression of
LO-O-OVE
Though you are free, I are trapped, trapped in
LO-O-OVE

EXECUTION
